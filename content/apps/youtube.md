> Watch videos with no ads and block sponsor segments, or listen to music
in the background with Patchside YouTube.

Patchside YouTube is a distribution of ReVanced YouTube, including
patches of my personal choosing. It is an improved version of the
Android YouTube app, providing the following features:
- Background play and PIP without premium
- Custom video speed
- Downloads for any video (with Newpipe)
- Certain buttons hidden (cast and create) for less clutter
- Old quality select UI
- Return YouTube Dislikes
- Sponsorblock (skip over sponsor segments, non-music parts of music videos, etc.)
- NO ADS. No video ads or any other home screen clutter

Remember that this is simply a distribution of [ReVanced] for my personal
tastes, but it's still general enough. If you want other things, patch
up yourself.
